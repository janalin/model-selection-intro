[comment]: Notes: The distribution fits nicely a gaussian for model 1-3 but best for model 2. This gives us already [comment]: a hint, since we know that the residual #variance $\sigma^2$ of the data generating process is normally [comment]: distributed: $\sigma^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. We used the same noise model #for all models, so [comment]: our model fit should satisfy also our observation model, _i. e._ $\sigma^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, [comment]: \sigma^2)$. We will see in the next section that the error due to residuals is _irreducible_.:wq
