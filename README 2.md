### Prerequisites
This is a bookdown document. The __bookdown__ package can be installed from CRAN or Github: <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown">https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown</a>
```
install.packages("bookdown")
```
The required R packages are listed in __packages.bib__.


### Add a new chapter
Create an Rmd file _XX-new_chapter.Rmd_ with a two digit chapter number _XX_.
Note that each Rmd file contains only one chapter. The chapter title is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
Bookdown documents are written in __Markdown__. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
